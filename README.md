##### Lorelai:

Through this project, I learned how to use React with Vite, Firebase Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting, and I learned how to implement that all with APIs to create a working application. This project definitely helped me strengthen my React skills, as I was not very confident with the syntax or the usage of hooks before. Creating my own app helped me understand what I would actually able to use React for in the future because I created my own components and figured out how they all related to each other on my own, rather than just copying an example and not thinking much about how the components relate to each other. Additionally, I learned how to use Firebase databases to store larger amounts of data more efficiently rather than using dictionaries or other data structures. This also helped with the Authentication part, because I was able to display only the data for that particular user, rather than displaying the data for everyone combined. 

One main problem we had was finding APIs that worked with our app. Originally, I had hoped to use the Spotify Web API, but after testing that out, I kept running into authentication errors. We also ran into issues with other APIs, such as the Zen Quote API that we had also initially intended on using. This, and many other APIs we tried, ran into problems with CORS. We went through multiple APIs but eventually found some that worked properly with our app, and we were able to adjust to using those ones instead. I had initially planned on working on the APIs first, but once I started working on the application I got distracted by what I realized I could do with components in React and I ended up putting off the APIs until the last minute, as I thought it would be easy since I had used many APIs before with no issues. What I learned from this experience was to try to work on the APIs first, rather than the pages or components of the app.
